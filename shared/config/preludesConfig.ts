You are among the last commanders to depart Terra Prime — carrying with you the final seed vaults, the classified archives of the Confederacy Fleet, and the weight of a civilization that no longer exists.\n\nYour convoy emerges from the slipstream above Veridian-7, a temperate world orbiting a stable K-type star. Sensors confirm breathable atmosphere, fresh water, and mineral deposits sufficient for industrial bootstrap. But the planet is not uninhabited. Automated defense grids from a forgotten expedition still pulse in orbit, and something else — a signal, ancient and deliberate — echoes from deep beneath the southern continent.\n\nAdmiral Vex, your chief strategist, advises caution. \"We have one chance to establish a foothold.

But peace is fragile.\n\nA convoy from the Kessler Drift — a loose coalition of merchant families and independent operators — arrives in system under the flag of parley. Trade Master Voss, their elected spokesman, proposes a mutual defense pact and shared access to the warp gates discovered in the outer system. It is an attractive offer. The Drift convoy carries rare deuterium reserves and navigational data that would take your engineers decades to compile.\n\nBut Envoy Halden, your diplomatic liaison, intercepts encrypted transmissions from the Drift fleet. They are coordinating with Void Corsair elements — pirates who have been raiding outer colonies for months. The alliance may be genuine, or it may be a trap. Meanwhile, a third faction — the Zyx Collective, a silicon-based hive intelligence — has begun probing Veridian-7's sensor grid. They are curious. They are watching.

Dr. Elara Kern, the colony's chief physicist, believes the signal originates from a structure buried kilometers beneath the planet's crust. She calls it the \"Nexus,\" and she is convinced it predates known galactic civilization by millions of years.\n\nThen the anomalies begin. Localized gravity distortions ripple across the colony. Ships in orbit report phantom radar contacts — vessels that match no known configuration. A research team on the southern continent goes silent. When a rescue expedition arrives, they find the team alive but unresponsive, standing in a circle around a newly opened sinkhole, staring into darkness.\n\nOracle Nira, a mysterious figure who arrived with the Zyx delegation, warns that the Nexus is a boundary marker — a seal placed by an ancient civilization to keep something contained. \"You have disturbed a lock,\" she says. \"And the thing behind it is now awake.\"",

      "With a fleet capable of projecting power beyond the home system, Veridian-7 faces a new challenge: the outer frontier. Deep-space surveys reveal a network of wormhole gates — ancient structures, possibly related to the Nexus — connecting distant regions of the galaxy. Control of these gates means control of interstellar travel itself.\n\nBut the gates are contested. The Void Corsairs have established a foothold around the Helios Gate, the most stable and strategically vital of the wormhole network. Admiral Zeph, your fleet commander, proposes a campaign to seize the gate — a campaign that will require every ship, every crew, and every tactical advantage you possess.\n\nThe Tides of Helios have begun.",

A faction within the Congress, led by Magistrate Kheir, calls for a tribunal to investigate war crimes — specifically, the civilian casualties during the Corsair siege of Station Kappa.\n\nThe tribunal is politically motivated, designed to undermine the military's influence and shift power toward the civilian judiciary. But the accusations are not entirely baseless. During the siege, a Corsair prisoner was executed without trial — an act that, while tactically justified, violated the colony's own emerging legal code.\n\nYou must navigate the tribunal without destroying the unity you've built — or the principles you're fighting for.",

Pathfinder Ryl, the colony's chief explorer, identifies a cluster of habitable worlds beyond the Helios Gate — the Stormline, a region of space battered by electromagnetic storms that make conventional navigation nearly impossible. But within the storms lie resources, strategic positions, and — according to Ryl's charts — the remains of an ancient shipyard.\n\nThe Stormline is contested territory. The Zyx Collective claims sovereignty over its inner worlds. The Merchant Guilds control its trade routes. And something else — something that moves within the storms themselves — has been detected by long-range sensors. An intelligence. Old. Patient. Watching.\n\nRyl presents the colonization proposal: establish a network of outpost stations within the Stormline, secure access to the ancient shipyard, and assert Veridian-7's presence before the region is claimed by others. The Congress approves — reluctantly. The risks are immense. The rewards, potentially civilization-defining.",

The ancient civilization that built the Nexus also built this weapon — and then destroyed it, scattering its components across the galaxy.\n\nNow, someone is reassembling it. Fragmented intelligence from Cipher Yva's network reveals that the Void Corsairs, the Zyx Collective, and at least one unknown faction are racing to collect the weapon components. If any single power assembles the weapon, the balance of the galaxy collapses overnight.\n\nHighseer Vale, an ancient figure who claims to have been a guardian of the original weapon's destruction, arrives at Veridian-7 with a proposal: join the race, secure the components, and ensure the weapon is never used. It is the only option. The alternative is to let it fall into the hands of those who would wield it.",
